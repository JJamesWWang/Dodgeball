1. No using GetComponent<> on another object unless you have to (such as when GameObjects are passed by Mirror).
    Reason: This could expose public fields that otherwise should remain hidden (treat components as private information)
    Fix: Create a method in the class you are accessing to follow the Law of Demeter. Use composition when necessary, but even try to avoid that.
2. Use var only when it is absolutely redundant to state the class name (foreach loops, GetComponent<>, the variable name is the same name as the class name).
