1. No using GetComponent<> on another object unless you have to (such as when GameObjects are passed by Mirror).
    Reason: This could expose public fields that otherwise should remain hidden (treat components as private information).
    Fix: Create a method in the class you are accessing to follow the Law of Demeter. Use composition when necessary, but even try to avoid that.
2. Use var only when it is absolutely redundant to state the class name (foreach loops, GetComponent<>, the variable name is the same name as the class name).
3. Public methods and variables should have a <summary> and serialized fields a [Tooltip()] if their usage is not obvious. Classes should have comments that list public properties, events, and methods.
4. Avoid using {} with if/else, for/foreach statements. You should be able to get enough done with one line, and if you can't, make a helper method.
5. One blank line between each method; one for logical separation as well
6. Some vocabulary:
    Handle -> an event
    Calculate -> a value
    Check -> check if conditions are met & do something if they are (if applicable)
    Show -> set ui elements visible
7. Imports in order: UnityEngine, Mirror, System, <...>
8. Class instance fields order:
    1) Private variables in order of relevance to core function
    2) Public variables in order of relevance to core function
    3) Public static Actions, server before client
9. Methods order:
    General before Server before Client always
    1) Awake, Start, OnDestroy, OnStartClient/Authority/Server, OnStopClient/Authority/Server
    2) Public methods that can be called
    3) Private methods immediately after they are called
    4) Unity event handling
    5) Event subscribing, handling (in order of subscribed), unsubscribing, and SyncVar hooks respectively
